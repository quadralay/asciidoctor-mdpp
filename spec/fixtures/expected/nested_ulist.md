### Transform Type

Each checkbox sets a different number of points when you click “Set Points”

- Translation: Sets one point for x/y translation
- Scale/Rotation: Sets two points to rotate or scale between points. Moving a point toward or away from the other point scales, moving a point at an angle the other causes rotation.
- Shear: Sets 3 points for allowing skew/shear adjustment
- Perspective: Sets 4 points for full 4-point corner-pin style perspective adjustment.
