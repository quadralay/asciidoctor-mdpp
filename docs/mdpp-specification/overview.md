# Markdown++ Specification Overview

This directory contains the specifications for Markdown++, an enhanced variant of standard Markdown. Markdown++ extends basic Markdown syntax with additional features designed to improve technical documentation capabilities.

## File Extension and Compatibility

Markdown++ files utilize the standard `.md` file extension, rather than a unique `.mdpp` extension. This design choice is fundamental to Markdown++'s philosophy and offers several key advantages:

*   **Seamless Integration**: By using the `.md` extension, Markdown++ files can be easily integrated into existing Markdown-based workflows, tools, and platforms without requiring special file type handling.
*   **Backward Compatibility**: Markdown++ is designed to be fully backward compatible with standard Markdown. This means that any Markdown++ file can be processed by a standard Markdown parser, which will render the document as a regular Markdown file. While Markdown++-specific features may not be fully interpreted by standard parsers, they are implemented in a way that gracefully degrades (e.g., as HTML comments) to maintain readability and prevent rendering errors.
*   **Enhanced Features**: Markdown++ introduces powerful features such as multiline tables, custom style tags, and file includes. These extensions are carefully designed to coexist with standard Markdown syntax, often leveraging HTML comments or other Markdown-compatible constructs to ensure broad compatibility.

This approach allows authors to create richer, more structured technical documentation using Markdown++ while ensuring that their content remains accessible and usable within the broader Markdown ecosystem.
