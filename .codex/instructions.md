For project-specific instructions, see the following files and directories:

- `codex.md` (root): overview of the project workflow and testing conventions.
- `docs/development-guide.md`: developer onboarding, test-driven workflow, and coding guidelines.
- `docs/mdpp-specification/`: Markdown++ language extension specifications (e.g., multiline tables).

Tracks these files to ensure any changes to workflows or specs are captured and committed.
