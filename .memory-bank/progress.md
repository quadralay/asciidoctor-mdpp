# Progress: Asciidoctor-MDPP

## What Works

The following features have been successfully implemented:

### Core Document Structure
- [x] Document-level layout and structure conversion
- [x] Section headers with appropriate levels (`#`, `##`, etc.)
- [x] Paragraphs with proper spacing
- [x] Preamble handling

### Block Elements
- [x] Ordered and unordered lists with proper nesting
- [x] Paragraphs with line breaks (using raw line processing)
- [x] Tables (both simple and multiline)
- [x] Admonitions (both fenced blocks and short-form)
- [x] Images with dimension attributes
- [x] Code blocks with language tags
- [x] Literal blocks
- [x] Example blocks
- [x] Page breaks
- [x] Thematic breaks (horizontal rules)
- [x] Video embeds (YouTube)

### Inline Elements
- [x] Inline formatting (strong/emphasis)
- [x] Inline images
- [x] Anchors and cross-references
- [x] Include directives

### MDPP Extensions
- [x] Style comments for admonitions, tables, etc.
- [x] Multiline table support
- [x] Include statement conversion (`include::file.adoc[]` ‚Üí `<!--include:file.md-->`)

## What's Left to Build

### Conversion Enhancements
- [ ] Improved list item line break handling
- [ ] Better support for complex nested structures
- [ ] Support for additional video providers beyond YouTube
- [ ] Enhanced error reporting for conversion issues

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Comprehensive usage documentation
- [ ] CLI improvements for batch processing
- [ ] Configuration options for customizing conversion behavior
- [x] Prepare for open-source GitHub release (including copyright and author attribution to Quadralay Corporation)

## Current Status

The project is in active development but already provides a solid foundation for AsciiDoc to Markdown++ conversion. It successfully converts most common AsciiDoc elements with good fidelity, with a few known limitations that are being addressed.

| Performance | ‚úÖ Ready | Performs well for most documents |

## Known Issues

### List Item Line Breaks
As documented in `docs/line-break-challenges.md`, there's a challenge with handling line breaks in list items:

- **Root Cause**: Asciidoctor's AST drops content after a trailing `+` in list items
- **Current Workaround**: Uses source location fallback to attempt recovery
- **Limitations**: 
  - Only works when source maps are enabled
  - Requires access to the original source files
  - May fail for complex nested content

### Table Source Parsing
Complex table handling requires direct source file access:

- **Root Cause**: The AST does not preserve multiline cell structure
- **Current Approach**: Parse the original source for tables
- **Limitations**:
  - Requires the original source files to be available
  - Falls back to simple rendering for complex cases that fail parsing

### Strict Fixture Matching
Test requirements create some development challenges:

- **Issue**: Tests require exact byte-for-byte matches, including newlines and whitespace
- **Impact**: Small changes in whitespace can break tests
- **Current Approach**: Careful handling of newlines and string trimming

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach
The project began with a focus on AST-based conversion, assuming the Asciidoctor AST would contain all necessary information.

### First Pivot: Source Access
When AST limitations were discovered (especially for tables and line breaks), the approach evolved to incorporate source file lookups as a fallback mechanism.

### Second Pivot: Testing Strategy
The testing strategy evolved to use strict fixture matching, which uncovered subtle issues with whitespace and newline handling.

### Current Direction
The project now uses a hybrid approach:
- AST-first for most conversions
- Source lookups for complex structures
- Carefully controlled whitespace and newline handling
- Test-driven development with comprehensive fixtures

This evolution has created a robust converter that balances fidelity with pragmatism, even in the face of AST limitations.
